# Ceremonies & ways of working

## Daily stand up
A standard agile ceremony done every day. Usually in the morning, but time varies between teams. Different teams will use different formats for the stand up. Some adopt the more traditional "yesterday, today, blockers" approach. Others "walk the board".

## “Sprint” planning
A standard agile ceremony where work is elaborated and planned for a timeboxed time horizon. The frequency of the planning meeting will differ across different teams, and may well change within the same team if the team decides to.

## “Sprint” retrospective
A standard agile ceremony done at the end of each sprint or work cycle. Review and reflect on the successes and failures of the sprint, make suggestions on processes the team may want to improve (or otherwise change) in future sprints and generally appraise the team work environment.

## Show and tell
An opportunity for members within a team to demonstrate (or talk about) recent achievements or milestones. Can be within a team or across RE/tech ops. Usually monthly (for cross tech-ops). Frequency will vary within teams.

## Firebreak
A timeboxed week between each quarter to break up the missions. Teams and individuals can work on things of interest for a week that isn’t directly related to a mission, with members from other teams as interests dictate and allow. Ideas are pitched to the group and then selected based on popularity and suitability. Sub-groups may then form to tackle the individual ideas for the week. A “show and tell” takes place at the end of the firebreak week. Not all teams participate in a firebreak. Firebreaks create an opportunity for teams or individuals to try something new and have some fun (or fix the bug that's been annoying them for weeks!).

## Pairing
Teams will often use pair programming on certain tasks. Pairs should rotate frequently in order to share knowledge around the team. But this will depend on the team structure and the nature of the work. Pairing workshop sessions are held on a monthly basis to allow people new to the paradigm a chance to have a go and get some experience on pairing best practices.
